# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jiro Serote, a 2nd Year Computer Science student at Malayan Colleges Laguna.

I got into CS because I spend a lot of time on my computer and wanted to know what's goin on in this thing for it to be able to run videogames and whatnot and how I can create stuff like that on my own.

Some things I want to do include...
- Creating at least one (1) complete game with my own code and assets using Godot (free and open source!)
- Eventually develop a bigger game after building up some experience by making smaller-scale projects first (maybe even something I'm confident enough in to distribute)
- Get around to setting up a Linux-based rig
