# üëã Hello! 
I'm **Jiro Serote**, a 2nd Year Computer Science student at Malayan Colleges Laguna.

I got into CS because I spend a lot of time on my computer and wanted to know what's goin on in this thing for it to be able to run videogames and whatnot and how I can create stuff like that on my own.

*Moving image of fish spinning...  On the internet... Truly a marvel of human engineering*

üìù **Some things I want to do include...**
- Creating at least one (1) complete game with my own code and assets using Godot (free and open source!)
- Eventually develop a bigger game after building up some experience by making smaller-scale projects first (maybe even something I'm confident enough in to distribute)
- Get around to setting up a Linux-based rig

## üìñ Cheat sheet 
`git version`<br>
- Check if git is installed, and what version is currently installed if it is.

`git init`<br>
- Initialize a Git repository.

`git add`<br>
- Add files to commit. File name comes after "add" `git add [filename]`. Use `git add .` to stage all available files.

`git commit`<br>
- Commit changes in a repository. To add a description to the commit, use `git commit -m "[message here]"`.

`git push`<br>
- Push changes to a local repository to a remote one.

`git pull`<br>
- "Pull" changes from a remote version of a local repository to get it up to date.
