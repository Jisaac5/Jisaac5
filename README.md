# üëã Hello! 
I'm **Jiro Serote**, a 2nd Year Computer Science student at **Malayan Colleges Laguna**.

I got into CS because I spend a lot of time on my computer and wanted to know what's goin on in this thing for it to be able to run videogames and whatnot and how I can create stuff like that on my own.

üìù **Some things I want to do include...**
- Creating at least one (1) complete game with my own code and assets using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) *(free and open source!)*
- Eventually develop a bigger game after building up some experience by making smaller-scale projects first (maybe even something I'm confident enough in to distribute)
- Get around to setting up a Linux-based rig

## üìñ Git command cheat sheet 
`git version`<br>
- Check if Git is installed, and what version is currently installed if it is.

`git init`<br>
- Initialize a Git repository.

`git add`<br>
- Add files to commit. File name comes after "add" `git add [filename]`. 
- Use `git add .` to stage all available files.

`git commit`<br>
- Commit changes in a repository. 
- To add a description to the commit, use `git commit -m "[message here]"`.

`git push`<br>
- Push changes to a local repository to a remote one.

`git pull`<br>
- "Pull" changes from a remote repository to its local version to get it up to date.

`git branch`<br>
- Check available Git branches and which branch you're currently working on

`git checkout`<br>
- Switch between Git branches. 
- To create a new branch, use `git checkout -b [branch name]`.

`git stash`<br>
- Save current changes and revert to a blank workspace without committing.
- To include only untracked files, use `git stash -u`.
- Access later using `git stash pop`
